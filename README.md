# SFML-Bouncing-ball-game


    One of my first game projects, created in 2019 with ugly code, rewrited in 07.20

# Description 
    
    Just a simple game which let me learn some basic features of SFML library.
    In this project i haven't used delta time to handle animations and moves yet.
    However i got basic knowledge about physics and moving objects smoothly, to get it nice looking.
